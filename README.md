This project encompasses the preparation, analysis, and visualization processes of understanding data. 

The dataset, pulled from Kaggle, displays information regarding Netflix shows and movies as well as their ratings/reviews on IMDb and TMDB. The source provides two datasets, titles and credits, which will be utilized in this exploratory analysis. 

Here are the steps I took with the datasets.
