# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dashboard ðŸŽ¥

## Data preparation, analysis, and visualization of Netflix shows and movies with ratings


This project encompasses the preparation, analysis, and visualization processes of understanding data. 

The dataset, pulled from Kaggle, displays information regarding Netflix shows and movies as well as their ratings/reviews on IMDb and TMDB. The source provides two datasets, titles and credits, which will be utilized in this exploratory analysis. 

### Here are the steps I took with the datasets. 
Excel
---
1. Pull data and open in Excel
2. Perform initial cleaning and preparation, including splitting up the comma-separated list in the "genres" column (limited to first 3 genres for convenience)

Python
---
1. Use pandas to get an overview of the datasets.
2. Remove null and duplicated titles from the file
3. Save and export to CSV file

SQL
---
1. Create tables with appropriate data types and insert data from CSV
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Export standout findings to Excel tables

Tableau
---
1. Import Excel tables and apply to appropriate charts
2. Create visualization dashboard
